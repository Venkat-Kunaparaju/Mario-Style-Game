# Mario-Style-Game

My first attempt to make a big game

All the fundamental aspects of the game are there (collision, attacking, NPCs, etc.), but building the levels and having multiple of them put too much on Pygame's engine and the game didn't run smoothly, so I never finished it.  


# Gameplay
You start at the home island and you can enter levels by walking into the light green portals

In the levels, you are meant to the enemies and collect the keys, which are just floating rectangles. They restore your health upon jumping into them

You can also press F when you are in the big white blocks to get information about your objective

You can attack the enemies by pressing Shift and facing a direction, and their health gradually goes down.

You have a health bar as well, so it is important to dodge the enemies' attacks if you want to stay alive
